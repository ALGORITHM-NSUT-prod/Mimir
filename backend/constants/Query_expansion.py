Query_expansion_prompt = """Given the following query: "{query}" and the current date "{current_date}" (for reference in this session), your task is to create an **action plan** to retrieve information step by step, based on your system knowledge of where different types of data are stored.  

üö® **STRICT RULES TO FOLLOW:**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Break down the query into logical steps.**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Each step consists of at least one specific query (no maximum limit).**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **For "AND" queries (multiple pieces of information needed), create multiple specific queries per step.**  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Determine if specific queries can be resolved using document-level searches or require direct retrieval.**  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **An action plan can have a minimum of 1 step and a maximum of 4 steps.**  
6Ô∏è‚É£ **If required, use previously known user knowledge to refine queries.**  
7.  **Before making queries, think very carefully about the timeline, what date is today, what date is the query asking for, and what date documents are typically released to determine accurately what documents you would have in the database and reason correctly.**
8. **If user mentions past, think how much documents would have been released after it**
---

## **üìå Action Plan Structure**
- **Each step must have at least one "specific query."**  
- **Document-level queries may be 0 or more per step.**  
- **Each specific query must have a specificity score (`0.0 - 1.0`) and extracted keywords.**  
- **Ensure the action plan is structured for efficient retrieval.**
- **DO NOT include a step that does not require more data retreival, if a step can be resolved with the information already known, it should be removed.**
- **May create (optional step) if the data retreived may not be confirmed to follow the action plan assumptions**.
- **If no specific year given , use the current year as a default. unless according to docuemnt release timelines from system information, that document wouldnt have been released**
---

## **üìå Guidelines for Query Expansion**
- Generate **specific queries** to retrieve data step-by-step.  
- **Split** queries that ask for more than one data into sub-queries, dont make queries that ask for multiple data in 1 query, use of comma or and is not allowed unless it is used a filter for logical and for a single query.
- **Ensure meaningful variation**:
  - Queries should be **precise and retrieval-ready** (e.g., add batch, semester, department, roll number if available).  
  - **Modify numeric values logically** (e.g., even ‚Üî odd semester if applicable).  
  - If timeframe is missing, **infer a reasonable session** (but never predict future years).  
- **Use both full form and abbreviation** if relevant.  
- **Maintain original query intent**‚Äîno unnecessary generalization. 
- **Document queries should not be too generic, they chould still contain semester, timeframe(if given), department, etc if available.**
- **whenever asking for roll number check for result of PREVIOUS semester for only specific branch given, unless asked data is of previous year then search for current result**
---

## **üìå Guidelines for Specificity Score (`specificity`)**
- Assign a **float value between `0.0` and `1.0`** to indicate how specific the original query is.  
- **Use the following reference scale:**  
  - **`1.0` ‚Üí Very specific** (e.g., `"What was student X's SGPA in 5th semester?"`)  
  - **`0.5` ‚Üí Moderately specific** (e.g., `"Tell me everything about professor X who taught CSE in 2024?"`)  
  - **`0.0` ‚Üí Very broad** (e.g., `"Tell me about placements at NSUT?"`)  
- **The specificity score applies to each specific query** inside the action plan.  

## **üìå Guidelines for Expansive score (`expansivity`)**
- Assign a **float value between `0.0` and `1.0`** to indicate how large the answer of the query can be expected to be.
- **Use the following reference scale:**
- **`1.0` ‚Üí Very large** (e.g., `"Give me the academic calendar"`)
- **`0.5` ‚Üí Moderately large** (e.g., `"Tell me about all the professors in CSE department?"`)
- **`0.0` ‚Üí Very small** (e.g., `"Tell me about the student X's roll number?"`)
---

### ** Guidelines for Keyword Extraction**
- Identify **unique identifiers** to enhance retrieval precision.
- Only extract keywords that are **critical for retrieving relevant results**.
  - **Positive examples:** values of: "roll number", "event name", "academic year", "2nd semester".
  - **Negative examples:** Generic terms like "NSUT", "students", "policy", "semester".
- **If no specific keywords are found, return an empty list**.

üìå Rules:
**At least one "specific query" per step each should be very unqiue do not make more than required but no max limit, without specific queries NO DATA will be returned.**
"Document queries" can be 0 or more per step.
Each "specific query" must have specificity and extracted keywords.
If multiple peices of information do not depend upon each other, they can be inquired in one step. different document queries can be inquired in the same step.
Only generate multiple steps if answer of 1 step will be used to get enough data for next step
Document_queries list can contain more tha 1 type of unrelated documents, try your best to reduce steps while increasing subqueries
try to make a step to get full forms of ambiguos data.
if data gathering by document query is ambiguos and may or may not depend upon previous data, you may create an (optional step) for it and mention it in the reason.
Ensure JSON is well-formed.

üìå Final Reminder
üö® STRICT RULES TO ENFORCE:
‚úî Action plan must be structured step-by-step.
‚úî Each step has at least one specific query.
‚úî Document queries should only be included if relevant.
‚úî Use previous user knowledge if available.
‚úî Queries must be highly precise and optimized for retrieval.
‚úî DO NOT HALLUCINATE AND GENERATE INFORMATION YOURSELF, ONLY USE INFORMATION YOU CAN ACCURATELY LOGICALLY INFER OR IS DIRECTLY GIVEN

üìå Previously Known User Knowledge: (maybe irrelvant, ignore if irrelevant to the query)

{user_knowledge}

If in doubt, refine the search further. Never assume.
